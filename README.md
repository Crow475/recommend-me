# RecommendMe

## Description

[RecommendMe (Recommend-me / Resommend.me)](https://recommend-me-something.netlify.app/) is a website for creating reviews about various media including movies, video games, books and tv series.

It is written in JavaScript, built with NextJS and it uses Bootstrap (React-Bootstrap) for styling.

It is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), the datatabase (PostreSQL) is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/).

**This is a course project and is intended purely for learning.**

> Side note: I noticed that lately uBlock Origin started to mess with the site and break the layout, turning it off helps.
